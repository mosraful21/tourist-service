Millennia ago, the island used to be an extension of the Teknaf peninsula, but at a later time some portion of this peninsula got submerged and thus the southernmost part of the aforementioned peninsula became an island, and was disconnected from the Bangladesh mainland. The first settlement started 250 years ago, in 18th century, by Arabian merchants who named the island 'Jazira'. During British occupation the island was named after the then Deputy Commissioner of Chittagong Mr. Martin as St. Martin Island.",

But most of the time the boat service from Cox's Bazar to St. Martin is not operating. From Teknaf there is regular sea Truck, ships or shallow engine boat. But the demand for the sea truck is so high that it is really hard some time to get tickets. And seeing no other options people get the shallow engine fishing boat which is never suggested.
